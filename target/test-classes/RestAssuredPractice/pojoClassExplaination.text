POJO stand for plain old java object
kind of data structure that will include fields with getter setter method

before creating pojo first understand the json hierarchy like which is parent and which is child.
below json viewer will give you idea about it

{
    "fields": {
       "project":
       {
          "key": "TEST"
       },
       "summary": "REST ye merry gentlemen.",
       "description": "Creating of an issue using project keys and issue type names using the REST API",
       "issuetype": {
          "name": "Bug"
       }
   }
}

issuetype and project name we will create seperate pojo class.
and class name does not matter and may it differ from actual name from json data like projects and issuetype. you can create class
with different name.

In pojo class you can create constructor automatically. from right click into pojo class > source > generate constructor using fields
If this is not generated as expected then before that just do right click > source > generate to string then try to create constructor 

We need to create one payload pojo class and inside this class we need to mention this all parameter like project, summary,
description, issue type.

After that again we need to create final pojo class which is called as fields because all information present inside fields and fields
is parent of all other parameter.
and inside this class we need to create getter and setter for payload pojo class.

This above json we need to create 4 pojo class.
Fields.class
IssueType.class
Payload.class
Projects.class
